<h2>The Factions</h2>
<h3>The Ruling Council of Waterdeep</h3>
<p>Over the last 100 years, the initiatives and actions taken by the Lords of Waterdeep have becom lest in the interest of the people of Waterdeep and the nation of Thay, and more in the interest of the rich and powerful. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excursions by the Gray Hand into the underdark to acquire rare resources</li>
<li>The occupation New Rockspell for access to adamantium mines and extortion of their skilled blacksmiths</li>
<li>Mandatory conscription of the poor into the Gray Hand to fight in these resource wars</li>
<li>Expansion of the Gray Hand, from a select elite strike force to a general military, exit and reallocation of resources from the Lords Alliance</li>
<li>High taxes on citizens, low taxes on corperations, with very little enforcement of safety standards</li>
</ul>
<p>The current Open Lord of Waterdeep is Smeffry Bezos, of the Redwood Merchant Conglomerate. Smeff stepped from his CEO position of 70 years to join the Lords of Waterdeep as the Open Lord 8 years ago. Lord Bezos since taking power has abused Waterdeep's military power, in expanding the gray hand, starting conscription, and &quot;securing resources&quot; with Waterdeep military power.</p>
<p>RWS, Redwood Warfare Services, has recieved massive contracts from Waterdeep to develop weapons to make Waterdeeps foes and inferiors tremble. Most notibly, each conscript receives a fighting suit. This suit is infused with highly advanced alchemical properties, that can keep a recruit fighting even after they have passed on. This is highly controversial, as the conscripted Gray Hands dont voluteer to wear these suits...</p>
<h3>The People's Hammer</h3>
<p>10 years ago, former Blackstaff Savra Safahr, saw the need to resurrect the The People's Hammer. Savra started The People's Hammer around 90 years ago with her special friend, Gabrielle. They used funds to gentrify the Dock ward through small business loans and grants by day, and crushed Xanathar Guild operations by night. For many years, the dock ward prospered. Recently, due to predatory laws favoring the rich and big business, the dock ward has regressed to their former state.</p>
<p>The People's Hammer uses corperate sabatage and secretly supports grassroots candidates for government positions to oppose Lord Bezos's Waterdeep. Recently, they have become more bold in their opposition - striking corperate and gray hand infrastructure. And its about to get a lot more bold.</p>
<h3>Death's Gauntlet</h3>
<p>Fort Kelemvor, run by an eccentric old dwarf named Durin Thickbeard, has grown significantly over the last 100 years. Thickbeard is obsessed with destroying all things necromantic, he doesnt necessarily care about the current class struggle. Recently, he has turned his agents to investigating strange new alchemical armor suites, and has set his sights on a shipment of product from out of town...</p>
<p>Fort Kelemvor is based out of the Castle Ward.</p>
<h3>Harpers</h3>
<p>Although many wealthy benefactors have turned away from the Harpers in favor of Lord Bezos' noble friendly policies, there are a few good nobles funding this underground network.</p>
<h2>Setting the scene</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The players, new to this city or not, have not chosen a side. They have been given a job by their fixer, Jimmy Jim, that almost seemed a little too good to be true. Escort a 2 wagon caravan into waterdeep in broad daylight, be paid handsomely for doing so. Shouldnt take more than an hour to get from the city they are starting just outside the north gate to an undisclosed location just in the center of the sea ward.</p>
<p>Players are given a newspaper while they wait, with several articles on the front page. They can ask more about them, but they arent getting more written than the first paragraph.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lord Bezos Cuts Corperate Taxes, Leading to Prosperity for ALL!</strong> - Lord Bezos, the current open Lord of Waterdeep, has come to concensus with the Masked Lords of Waterdeep on cut corperate taxes to an all time low! By completely cutting contributions to the lazy Lords Alliance, and trimming cruft from bloated worker protection laws, we can finally all benefit from the power of trickle down economics!</li>
<li><strong>Terrorist Group Peoples Hammer Destroy Redwood Merchant Services Depot</strong> - Redwood Merchant Services, the biggest employer in all of waterdeep, held a press release today concerning the bombing of their largest Dock Ward Depot. &quot;These terrorists dont understand, we brought jobs into this area, and support other local businesses. Anyone that tells you having a Redwood Prime Depot in your neighborhood is harmful is a goddamn snowflake.&quot; No Redwood employees were affected by last nights act of violence.</li>
<li><strong>Griffin Rescue Celebrates Birth of Rare Crested Pheldygrif</strong> - Last weekend, Good Friends Griffin Rescue welcomed a tiny new member to its family. &quot;Its just so rare to have any Pheldygrif give birth in captivity&quot; Remarked former Blackstaff, now Griffin Rancher Savra Safahr. &quot;We dont know why or how a baby Pheldygrif is concieved, so when it happens, we consider it a sign of good fortune to come!&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Force Gray Secure Eastern Adamantine</strong> - Waterdeeps own Force Gray once again used a combination of wit and might to make sure we are safe. The Myconid Wood Dwarves threatend Waterdeeps resource security by attempting to broker deals with neighboring power Darkrun. Fortunately, our boys struck fiercely in the dead of night, causing Myconid demagogue Harrom Steelward to concede to Waterdeep demands before sunrise.</li>
<li><strong>Food Prices Soar, Waterdeep Nobles To the Rescue!</strong> - In response to high inflation affecting the everyday Waterdavian, Soup Kitchens and Commnunity food pantries have been stretched to their limit. Luckily, nobles from the White Rose Society and The Pink Ladies have come together with a massive donation to Dock ward and Southern ward community services. &quot;This donation was absolutely necessary to help keep our doors open. After the recent cuts to Waterdeep social programms, we have operated with very thin margins&quot; commented Milo Quarterling Jr, head of The Trollskull Project. With efforts like these, we have no need for the recently downsized Ministry of Welfare!</li>
<li><strong>Ad in corner of paper</strong> - Seen any undead? Leave tips at your local Dead enforcement agency! 2GP for successful lead.</li>
</ol>
<p>The players know two things about the job -</p>
<ol>
<li>They are to wait at this rendevous point just outside of the north gate</li>
<li>They need to protect the convoy, which will have two wagons, until it reaches an undisclosed location in the sea ward</li>
</ol>
<p>They will be paid handsomely if the cargo arrives to the drop point.</p>
<p>This is the first time the party has worked together. Jimmy Jim has brought together &quot;the A team&quot; for this job. He sold it as easy money.</p>
<h3>Convoy Approaches</h3>
<p>Location: North of Field ward</p>
<p>2 wagons, pulled by strange lumbering eldritch machines, appear on a hillside in the distance. Around the carts, we see 8 guards dressed in the garb of Force Gray. They are clad in a strange, unfamilar armor, with tubes pulsing with shiny blue liquids. One is at the head, obviously the leader, with brilliant red hair and a creepy mustache to complement it.</p>
<p>The wagons make their way to the Rendevous point. The party did not know that they would be escorting goods with Force Gray, the fixer had been very discrete.</p>
<p>The leader of the convoy approaches - Squiddly Dahmer the Third. He introduces himself and asks if this is the convoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Hello there, would you be our escort from waterdeep?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I told Redwood we could handle this on our own, we are, after all, Force Grey.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Please, take the caravan from the behind. Dont get in the way, you will be told when you are needed&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Entering Waterdeep</h3>
<p>Location: North Gate, Field Ward</p>
<p>Description - Approaching waterdeep, you see a 40 foot tall wall running from the hillside all the way to the sword coast. Following the road you are travelling leads to a tall, fortified gate. Guards bristle from the spires above, already peering your way.</p>
<p>The guards let the first caravan into the gate and begin an inspection. You see Squiddly pass a change purse to the head inspector. He grabs a paladin in dark armor approaching the wagon and leads him away. Squiddly motions the troops to move forward, and motions yall to come through.</p>
<p>A different stout dwarf approaches a member of the party and asks who is in charge of this wagon. Dudley Dwarfstein, Assistant manager of caravan inspection, is looking to get a little tip on top of his hourly wage.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Who's in charge here&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Im just looking for a little 'motivation' to not the call in our one of our specialized inspectors&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I know whats in there, and i know Deaths Gauntlet wont be pleased to hear about this&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Squiddly reels around the corner right as Dudley decides to have a chat with an inspector know as Hork Steeltoes. He picks up the dwarf and pushes him against the wall - murmuring a few threat you cant seem to make out. He calls you pathetic, and tells you to follow.</p>
<h3>Field ward</h3>
<p>Description - The Field Ward of Waterdeep was an unofficial ward of the city, located between the inner and outer walls on the north side of town. It was in fact the city's slums — possessing the poorest living conditions within the city, was rife with crime, and served as a home to the most destitute Waterdhavian citizens.</p>
<p>As your caravan moves through the scraggly fields and groups of shanties, you notice the many curious eyes of destitute people following you. A small human boy, malnourished, looking no older than 12, approaches your caravan and inquires:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What is wrong with your horse&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Why are you coming from the north? only things that come in from the north are foodstuffs&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Could i have some hardtack? i know you have some hardtack in your bag, being an adventurer and all&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Squiddly stops the caravan, orders a guard to take care of the kid.</p>
<h3>Sea ward</h3>
<p>The sea ward is a harsh juxtaposition from the Field ward. You walk into this part of the city and see pure opulence.</p>
<p>A begger comes up to a party member, asking for money. Says he used to own a corner store until redwood came along.</p>
<p>You look up to the rooftops - several dwarves are leaping from rooftop to rooftop</p>
<p>The party is separated from the Force Grey caravan by 75m.</p>
<p>Durin Thickbeard confronts the Squiddly, as he knows the payload is ichor, used for reanimating dead Force grey troops. It isnt explicitly said what he knows, players still dont know. Squiddly cuts Durin's arm off mid conversation, Durin is saved by another paladin when he attempts to lay a second blow.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Post combat</h4>
<p>Looking towards the othe caravan, you seen carnage. The bodies of the Force Grey solders lay on the street, torn asunder. There is one last soldier backing away from several figures you see in the distance. Two shots fire, blowing off half of the soldiers neck. As the soldier falls, you see the armor's mechanism inject all of the swirling fluids into the soldier. His neck fills with a jet black shiny substance, he puke black bile, and three gnarled sharp appendages burst from his back. In a feat of incredible speed, he begins to sprint towards the human figures that assaulted the caravan. The scythes whip back and forth, deflecting gunfire. The necromantic monstrosity goes down just as fast as it got back up though - a man with a huge hammer matches its speed, swinging the hammer through the center of its body. Its appendages fly everywhere.</p>
<h4>Chat with Colt Remington III</h4>
<p>Colt approaches the party, badly beaten. He wears a torn up wife beater and a plaid kilt that doesnt leave much to the imagination. His hammer is crimson with yellow trim, inscribed with <code>unionize or die</code> along the hilt. You notice colt is bleeding and pretty beaten up - something strange though, some of the blood is black.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Hey yall, I know its been a rough day for both of us. Yall are mercenaries, i know yall didnt know who this job was for. Been runnin raids on these caravans for nearly half a year now.&quot; Stops and pulls out a syringe, plunges it into his arm and gasps. Wounds begin to close up, black bile leaks from his eyes. &quot;Yer day aint over yet. Im here to give you a choice that you dont have much time to think over. Force Grey is on their way now - you can either stay here, and deal with the consequences of losing these convoys. Or you can come with us, and get outta town. Have an opportunity to lie low, stick it to the man. &quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Im leaving with that caravan no matter what.&quot; there are 8 rag tag soldiers behind him.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choice 1: Wait for Force Grey</h3>
<p>The following events will occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colt will tell the party to back off. They hotwire the eldritch machine, and hop on the back of the wagon. It begins striding at an incredible pace.</li>
<li>Force Grey immediately shows up via portal and takes the party into custody.</li>
<li>The party is interrogated. Midway through interrogation, the investigator gets wind of a griffin spotting the machines.</li>
<li>The party gets on a griffin and is teleported to the location of the chase. They have the opportunity to snag one wagon.</li>
<li>The party is then sent to Fort Kelemvor, along with an artillery crew. Their job is to break through the forcemages protection spell so that the eldritch artillery can knock down the gate, and seize the fort.</li>
</ul>
<h4>NPCs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Squiddly will be the interrogator</li>
<li>Fred Foreman will be the commander in charge of the assault on Kelemvor's gates.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Force Grey arrives</h4>
<p>A couple squads of Force Grey soldiers, clad in the same armor, coursing with shimmering fluids, stream from two portals that appear on each side of the party. Out strides Squiddly Dahmer, demanding that the party be tied up -</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I KNEW they were traitors fromm the start! We should have been able to spare another squad of men.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Are they paying you more than we had offered? &quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choice 2: Go with Colt</h3>
<p>The following events will occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>You hop on the hotwired eldritch machine with Colt. It takes off at an incredible speed.</li>
<li>Griffins appear from portals. You must fend them off, or risk taking significant damage.</li>
<li>You arrive at Fort Kelemvor, the preprogrammed destination of the machine. The guards let you in. You can either say you brought it for them, or you are seeking sanctuary at Kelemvor.</li>
<li>Portals appear, horde and cannons appear. Destroy the forcemages so you can destroy the cannons.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Griffin chase</h4>
<p>Griffins start 30 feet away</p>
<p>Party starts as 3 on each side of the caravan - have them roll initiative</p>
<p>2 griffins are chasing the cart, each with a rider with a halberd, and a mage that can cast magic missle</p>
<p>They gain 10 feet each round. the party must last 5 rounds to get to Fort Kelemvor.</p>
<h4>Fort Kelemvor</h4>
<p>If the players have not killed the griffins, the fort fires cannons and knocks them out of the sky. The doors slowly open -</p>
<p>When the players pull into the fort, they notice that Colts eyes have rolled into the back of his head. he has fallen backwards and black bile is flowing steadily out of his mouth, while making gasping noises.</p>
<p>Several paladins approach them. Colt coughs - &quot;we need it for the cause, dont let em... &quot;</p>
<h2>Todo</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write newspaper for intro</li>
<li>Make cards for new equipment</li>
<li>Write down mechanics for griffin encounter</li>
<li>Figure out how zone combat will work for kelemvor battle</li>
<li>NPC details for squiddly and fred</li>
</ul>
<h2>Escape from Kelemvor</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Death is but part of life: fear it not, evade it not, and view it not as evil. To fear death delivers you into the hands of those who can bring death down upon you. Die with dignity, neither raging nor seeking to embrace undeath. Do honor to the dead, for their strivings in life brought Faerun to where it is now, and to forget them is to forget also where we are now—and why.
”
— Kelemvor's charge to novitiates</p>
