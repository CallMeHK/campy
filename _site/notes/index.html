<h2>The Factions</h2>
<h3>The Ruling Council of Waterdeep</h3>
<p>Over the last 100 years, the initiatives and actions taken by the Lords of Waterdeep have becom lest in the interest of the people of Waterdeep and the nation of Thay, and more in the interest of the rich and powerful. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excursions by the Gray Hand into the underdark to acquire rare resources</li>
<li>The occupation New Rockspell for access to adamantium mines and extortion of their skilled blacksmiths</li>
<li>Mandatory conscription of the poor into the Gray Hand to fight in these resource wars</li>
<li>Expansion of the Gray Hand, from a select elite strike force to a general military, exit and reallocation of resources from the Lords Alliance</li>
<li>High taxes on citizens, low taxes on corperations, with very little enforcement of safety standards</li>
</ul>
<p>The current Open Lord of Waterdeep is Smeffry Bezos, of the Redwood Merchant Conglomerate. Smeff stepped from his CEO position of 70 years to join the Lords of Waterdeep as the Open Lord 8 years ago. Lord Bezos since taking power has abused Waterdeep's military power, in expanding the gray hand, starting conscription, and &quot;securing resources&quot; with Waterdeep military power.</p>
<p>RWS, Redwood Warfare Services, has recieved massive contracts from Waterdeep to develop weapons to make Waterdeeps foes and inferiors tremble. Most notibly, each conscript receives a fighting suit. This suit is infused with highly advanced alchemical properties, that can keep a recruit fighting even after they have passed on. This is highly controversial, as the conscripted Gray Hands dont voluteer to wear these suits...</p>
<h3>The People's Hammer</h3>
<p>10 years ago, former Blackstaff Savra Safahr, saw the need to resurrect the The People's Hammer. Savra started The People's Hammer around 90 years ago with her special friend, Gabrielle. They used funds to gentrify the Dock ward through small business loans and grants by day, and crushed Xanathar Guild operations by night. For many years, the dock ward prospered. Recently, due to predatory laws favoring the rich and big business, the dock ward has regressed to their former state.</p>
<p>The People's Hammer uses corperate sabatage and secretly supports grassroots candidates for government positions to oppose Lord Bezos's Waterdeep. Recently, they have become more bold in their opposition - striking corperate and gray hand infrastructure. And its about to get a lot more bold.</p>
<h3>Death's Gauntlet</h3>
<p>Fort Kelemvor, run by an eccentric old dwarf named Durin Thickbeard, has grown significantly over the last 100 years. Thickbeard is obsessed with destroying all things necromantic, he doesnt necessarily care about the current class struggle. Recently, he has turned his agents to investigating strange new alchemical armor suites, and has set his sights on a shipment of product from out of town...</p>
<p>Fort Kelemvor is based out of the Castle Ward.</p>
<h3>Harpers</h3>
<p>Although many wealthy benefactors have turned away from the Harpers in favor of Lord Bezos' noble friendly policies, there are a few good nobles funding this underground network.</p>
<h2>Setting the scene</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The players, new to this city or not, have not chosen a side. They have been given a job by their fixer, Jimmy Jim, that almost seemed a little too good to be true. Escort a 2 wagon caravan into waterdeep in broad daylight, be paid handsomely for doing so. Shouldnt take more than an hour to get from the city they are starting just outside the north gate to an undisclosed location just in the center of the sea ward.</p>
<p>Players are given a newspaper while they wait, with several articles on the front page. They can ask more about them, but they arent getting more written than the first paragraph.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lord Bezos Cuts Corperate Taxes, Leading to Prosperity for ALL!</strong> - Lord Bezos, the current open Lord of Waterdeep, has come to concensus with the Masked Lords of Waterdeep on cut corperate taxes to an all time low! By completely cutting contributions to the lazy Lords Alliance, and trimming cruft from bloated worker protection laws, we can finally all benefit from the power of trickle down economics!</li>
<li><strong>Terrorist Group Peoples Hammer Destroy Redwood Merchant Services Depot</strong> - Redwood Merchant Services, the biggest employer in all of waterdeep, held a press release today concerning the bombing of their largest Dock Ward Depot. &quot;These terrorists dont understand, we brought jobs into this area, and support other local businesses. Anyone that tells you having a Redwood Prime Depot in your neighborhood is harmful is a goddamn snowflake.&quot; No Redwood employees were affected by last nights act of violence.</li>
<li><strong>Griffin Rescue Celebrates Birth of Rare Crested Pheldygrif</strong> - Last weekend, Good Friends Griffin Rescue welcomed a tiny new member to its family. &quot;Its just so rare to have any Pheldygrif give birth in captivity&quot; Remarked former Blackstaff, now Griffin Rancher Savra Safahr. &quot;We dont know why or how a baby Pheldygrif is concieved, so when it happens, we consider it a sign of good fortune to come!&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Force Gray Secure Eastern Adamantine</strong> - Waterdeeps own Force Gray once again used a combination of wit and might to make sure we are safe. The Myconid Wood Dwarves threatend Waterdeeps resource security by attempting to broker deals with neighboring power Darkrun. Fortunately, our boys struck fiercely in the dead of night, causing Myconid demagogue Harrom Steelward to concede to Waterdeep demands before sunrise.</li>
<li><strong>Food Prices Soar, Waterdeep Nobles To the Rescue!</strong> - In response to high inflation affecting the everyday Waterdavian, Soup Kitchens and Commnunity food pantries have been stretched to their limit. Luckily, nobles from the White Rose Society and The Pnk Ladies have come together with a massive donation to Dock ward and Southern ward community services. With efforts like these, we have no need for the recently downsized Ministry of Welfare!</li>
