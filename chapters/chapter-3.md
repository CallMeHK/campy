## Escape from Kelemvor

<blockquote>
Death is but part of life: fear it not, evade it not, and view it not as evil. To fear death delivers you into the hands of those who can bring death down upon you. Die with dignity, neither raging nor seeking to embrace undeath. Do honor to the dead, for their strivings in life brought Faerun to where it is now, and to forget them is to forget also where we are now—and why.

### Aftermath

After the battle at the gate, the party came to talk to the head Paladin about the friendly fire. While voicing their frustrations, Colt Remington, still in the middle of the courtyard, began thrashing and speaking in unrecognizable tongues. Jenry slid into a trance and began slowly making his way over to Colt, as he continued to thrash and have tendrils emerge from his back. 

The Kelemvor paladins spring into action, containing Colt in a ball of stone. They then turn on the weakened party, questioning their purity based on their relationship with Colt and Jenry's trance, which he had just snapped out of. The party is disarmed, blindfolded and taken to be imprisoned on Fort Kelemvor. 

### Prison Map

The crew finds themselves in Kelemvor's Grace Penitentiary, a small but fortified jail in [Fort Kelemvor](/assets/jail.jpeg). There are 4 subfloors and a main floor:

    - A guard and a prisoner walk out of the torture chamber when the party comes up the stairs. 
    - The cells are full of what look to be Force Grey members of many different races, it is very crowded. It is clear that some of them have had a large dose of oil by the black under their eyes.
    - 2 guards are resting in the guards quarters
    - 2 leutenents that the party recognizes from the battle are in a meeting in the nice room. they walk out when the party can see into the room.

### In a cell

We begin the session in the cells on floor B3. have the party place themselves randomly in each of the four cells. Describe it as a nice new construction, the benches in the cells look brand new, the toilets are spotless, etc. 

A guard approaches Chad - 

"Look, your meathead on the front page hahaha"

Hands him a paper -

<b>Waterdeep Daily</b>

Drawn picture of the party fighting Force Grey with a perfectly drawn Chad. The other five party members look vastly different than they actually are - callisto is a half orc, quark looks goliath sized, eloise is drawn as an old hag, Jenry is covered in feathers, and morrah is a scorpion. 

<b>Terrorists Ambush Force Grey On Peacekeeping Effort</b>

Early evening yesterday, terrorists attack Force Grey on a peacekeeping mission to Fort Kelemvor. War hero and model citizen Chad (lastname) appears to have lead the incursion. Without honor, Chad's insurgents attacked the Force Grey division without warning, slaughtering every single one. There is a 10000 gold reward for the heads of any of these criminals.
